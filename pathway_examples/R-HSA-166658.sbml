      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the complement cascade, a panel of soluble molecules rapidly and effectively senses a danger or damage and triggers reactions to provide a response that discriminates among foreign intruders, cellular debris, healthy and altered host cells (Ricklin D et al. 2010). Complement proteins circulate in the blood stream in functionally inactive states. When triggered the complement cascade generates enzymatically active molecules (such as C3/C5 convertases) and biological effectors: opsonins (C3b, C3d and C4b), anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), and C5b, which initiates assembly of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC). Three branches lead to complement activation: the classical, lectin and alternative pathways (Kang YH et al. 2009; Ricklin D et al. 2010). The classical pathway is initiated by C1 complex binding to immune complexes, pentraxins or other targets such as apoptotic cells leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 components and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The lectin pathway is activated by binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) to repetitive carbohydrate residues, or by binding of ficolins to carbohydrate or acetylated groups on target surfaces. MBL and ficolins interact with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP) leading to cleavage of C4 and C2 and formation of the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. The alternative pathway is spontaneously activated by the hydrolysis of the internal thioester group of C3 to give C3(H2O). Alternative pathway activation involves interaction of C3(H2O) and/or previously generated C3b with factor B, which is cleaved by factor D to generate the alternative C3 convertases C3(H2O)Bb and/or C3bBb. All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form opsonin C3b and anaphylatoxin C3a. C3b covalently binds to glycoproteins scattered across the target cell surface. This is followed by an amplification reaction that generates additional C3 convertases and deposits more C3b at the local site. C3b can also bind to C3 convertases switching them to C5 convertases, which mediate C5 cleavage leading to MAC formation. Thus, the activation of the complement system leads to several important outcomes: opsonization of target cells to enhance phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (MAC) assembly on the cell surface, production of anaphylatoxins C3a/C5a involved in the host inflammatory response, C5a-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis, and clearance of antibody-antigen complexes. The complement system is able to distinguish between pathological and physiological challenges, i.e. the outcomes of complement activation are predetermined by the trigger and are tightly tuned by a combination of initiation events with several regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms use soluble (e.g., C4BP, CFI and CFH) and membrane-bound regulators (e.g., CR1, CD46(MCP), CD55(DAF) and CD59) and are coordinated by complement receptors such as CR1, CR2, etc. In response to microbial infection complement activation results in flagging microorganisms with opsonins for facilitated phagocytosis, formation of MAC on cells such as Gram-negative bacteria leading to cell lysis, and release of C3a and C5a to stimulate downstream immune responses and to attract leukocytes. Most pathogens can be eliminated by these complement-mediated host responses, though some pathogenic microorganisms have developed ways of avoiding complement recognition or blocking host complement attack resulting in greater virulence (Lambris JD et al. 2008; Serruto D et al. 2010). All three complement pathways (classical, lectin and alternative) have been implicated in clearance of dying cells (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001; Gullstrand B et al.2009; Kemper C et al. 2008). Altered surfaces of apoptotic cells are recognized by complement proteins leading to opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis. In contrast to pathogens, apoptotic cells are believed to induce only a limited complement activation by allowing opsonization of altered surfaces but restricting the terminal pathway of MAC formation (Gershov D et al. 2000; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M 2011). Thus, opsonization facilitates clearance of dying cells and cell debris without triggering danger signals and further inflammatory responses (Fraser DA et al. 2007, 2009; Benoit ME et al. 2012). C1q-mediated complement activation by apoptotic cells has been shown in a variety of human cells: keratinocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cells, lung adenocarcinoma cells (Korb LC and Ahearn JM 1997; Mold C and Morris CA 2001; Navratil JS et al. 2001; Nauta AJ et al. 2004). In addition to C1q the opsonization of apoptotic Jurkat T cells with MBL also facilitated clearance of these cells by both dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Nauta AJ et al. 2004). Also C3b, iC3b and C4b deposition on apoptotic cells as a consequence of activation of the complement cascade may promote complement-mediated phagocytosis. C1q, MBL and cleavage fragments of C3/C4 can bind to several receptors expressed on macrophages (e.g. cC1qR (calreticulin), CR1, CR3, CR4) suggesting a potential clearance mechanism through this interaction (Mevorach D et al. 1998; Ogden CA et al. 2001). Apoptosis is also associated with an altered expression of complement regulators on the surface of apoptotic cells. CD46 (MCP) bound to the plasma membrane of a healthy cell protects it from complement-mediated attack by preventing deposition of C3b and C4b, and reduced expression of CD46 on dying cells may lead to enhanced opsonization (Elward K et al. 2005). Upregulation of CD55 (DAF) and CD59 on apoptotic cell surfaces may protect damaged cells against complement mediated lysis (Pedersen ED et al. 2007; Iborra A et al. 2003; Hensel F et al. 2001). In addition, fluid-phase complement regulators such as C4BP, CFH may also inhibit lysis of apoptotic cells by limiting complement activation (Trouw LA et al 2007; Braunschweig A and Jozsi M. 2011). Complement facilitates the clearance of immune complexes (IC) from the circulation (Chevalier J and Kazatchkine MD 1989; Nielsen CH et al. 1997). Erythrocytes bear clusters of complement receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35), which serves as an immune adherence receptor for C3 and/or C4 fragments deposited on IC that are shuttled to liver and spleen, where IC are transferred and processed by tissue macrophages through an Fc receptor-mediated process. Complement proteins are always present in the blood and a small percentage spontaneously activate. Inappropriate activation leads to host cell damage, so on healthy human cells any complement activation or amplification is strictly regulated by surface-bound regulators that accelerate decay of the convertases (CR1, CD55), act as a cofactor for the factor I (CFI)-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b (CR1, CD46), or prevent the formation of MAC (CD59). Soluble regulators such as C4BP, CFH and FHL1 recognize self surface pattern-like glycosaminoglycans and further impair activation. Complement components interact with other biological systems. Upon microbial infection complement acts in cooperation with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to amplify innate host defense. Anaphylatoxin C5a binds C5a receptor (C5aR) resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the TLR and C5aR-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response to infection. This interplay is negatively modulated by co-ligation of TLR and the second C5a receptor, C5L2, suggesting the existence of complex immunomodulatory interactions (Kohl J 2006; Hajishengallis G and Lambris JD 2010). In addition to C5aR and C5L2, complement receptor 3 (CR3) facilitates TLR2 or TLR4 signaling pathways by promoting a recruitment of their sorting adaptor TIRAP (MAL) to the receptor complex (van Bruggen R et al. 2007; Kagan JC and Medzhitov R 2006). Complement may activate platelets or facilitate biochemical and morphological changes in the endothelium potentiating coagulation and contributing to homeostasis in response to injury (Oikonomopoulou K et al. 2012). The interplay of complement and coagulation also involves cleavage of C3 and C5 convertases by coagulation proteases, generating biologically active anaphylatoxins (Amara U et al. 2010). Complement is believed to link the innate response to both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Toapanta FR and Ross TM 2006; Mongini PK et al. 1997). The majority of published data is based on experiments using mouse as a model organism. Further characterization of the influence of complement on B or T cell activation is required for the human system, since differences between murine models and the human system are not yet fully determined. Complement is also involved in regulation of mobilization and homing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to the circulation and peripheral tissue in order to accommodate blood cell replenishment (Reca R et al. 2006). Thus, the complement system orchestrates the host defense by sensing a danger signal and transmitting it into specific cellular responses while extensively communicating with associated biological pathways ranging from immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development. Originally the larger fragment of Complement Factor 2 (C2) was designated C2a. However, complement scientists decided that the smaller of all C fragments should be designated with an 'a', the larger with a 'b', changing the nomenclature for C2. Recent literature may use the updated nomenclature and refer to the larger C2 fragment as C2b, and refer to the classical C3 convertase as C4bC2b. Throughout this pathway Reactome adheres to the original convention to agree with the current (Sep 2013) Uniprot names for C2 fragments. The complement cascade pathway is organised into the following sections: initial triggering, activation of C3 and C5, terminal pathway and regulation.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This CandidateSet contains sequences identified by William Pearson's analysis of Reactome catalyst entities. Catalyst entity sequences were used to identify analagous sequences that shared overall homology and active site homology. Sequences in this Candidate set were identified in an April 24, 2012 analysis. Further candidates were identified by Ralf Stephan in a July 15, 2023 analysis.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Factor H (CFH) regulates the alternative pathway C3 convertase C3bBb and its C3b component both in plasma and at host cell surfaces. CFH binds to membrane-associated C3b, competing with Factor B and thereby preventing formation of the active C3 convertase C3bBb. In addition, it acts as a cofactor for the Factor I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C3b to iC3b.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decay-accelerating-factor (DAF, CD55) is a membrane- bound complement regulatory protein that inhibits autologous complement cascade activation. It is expressed on all cells that are in close contact with serum complement proteins, but also on cells outside the vascular space and on tumour cells. DAF binds to C3bBb and C4bC2a on cell surfaces, accelerating their dissociation and thereby inhibiting the amplification of complement. DAF can bind C3b and Bb, and must bind both for efficient decay acceleration. Although it can bind the inactive proenzymes C3b and C4b, the regulatory function of DAF is believed to be inhibition of activated C3 convertase enzymes (Harris et al. 2007).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The complement component 3a receptor (C3AR) binds C3a, a 77-amino acid anaphylatoxin generated after proteolytic cleavage of C3 and C5 in response to complement activation. C3a is involved in a variety of inflammatory responses including chemotaxis and activation of granulocytes, mast cells and macrophages (Peng et al. 200, Klos et al. 2009).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Factor I (CFI) cleaves the truncated alpha (a') chain of C4b between Arg-1336 and Asn-1337 and then again between Arg-956 and Thr-957, producing a 16 kDa fragment known as alpha4, derived from the C terminus of the a' chain, followed by a 27 kDa alpha3 fragment. The remaining alpha 2 (C4d) fragment stays covalently bound to the cell membrane while the complex of disulfide-linked alpha3, alpha4, beta chain and gamma chain are released (C4c) into the fluid phase (Fujita et al. 1978).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C2 is cleaved into the large C2a and the small C2b fragment. This irreversible, extracellular reaction can be catalyzed by activated MBL, generated through the lectin pathway of complement activation (Vorup-Jensen et al. 2000), and by activated C1, generated through the classical pathway (Nasagawa and Stroud 1977). N.B. Early literature refers to the larger fragment of C2 as C2a. However, complement scientists decided that the smaller of all C fragments should be designated with an 'a', the larger with a 'b', changing the nomenclature for C2. For this reason recent literature may refer to the larger C2 fragment as C2b, and the classical C3 convertase as C4bC2b. Throughout this pathway, Reactome uses the current (Feb 2012) Uniprot names which adhere to the original naming practice.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CD59, the major inhibitor of the complement membrane attack complex, is an 18–20 kDa glycoprotein, linked to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor. It interacts with complement components C8 and C9 during assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and inhibits C9 polymerization, thus preventing the formation of MAC [Lehto T and Meri S. 1993;Rollins SA et al 1991]</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Activation of the complement system significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous acute and chronic diseases. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize the human complement protein C5 have been shown to effectively block C5 cleavage, thereby preventing the generation of pro-inflammatory complement components (Thomas et al. 1996, review Horiuchi and Tsukamoto 2016). The mAb eculizumab was the first therapeutic for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (Rother et al. 2007). Ravulizumab, also used to treat PNH, was engineered from eculizumab to have an inherently longer circulating half-life so as to extend dosing intervals (Sheridan et al. 2018). Tesidolumab is an investigational mAb targeting complement C5, inhibiting terminal complement activation. Zilucoplan is a small macrocyclic peptide that binds to C5 with high affinity and specificity. It is being investigated for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG), a rare autoimmune disease (Howard et al. 2020).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C3(H2O):Factor Bb is a C3 convertase, sometimes referred to as the initial C3 convertase (iC3). The Factor Bb component catalyzes the hydrolysis of C3 to produce C3b and C3a. This reaction is not known to be directly coupled to the association of C3b complexes with a cell surface. It is believed that a small proportion of C3b spontaneously associates with the cell surface, otherwise it is rapidly inactivated (Muller-Eberhard 1988).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most abundant form of C4b-binding protein (C4BP) consists of seven alpha-chains (70kDa) and one beta-chain (45kDa) all linked by disulphide bonds to form a native protein with a molecular weight of 570kDa (Hilarp et al. 1989). Each alpha chain can bind C4b; it is not known whether full occupancy is necessary for subsequent events. The beta chain binds and inactivates Protein S, a component of the coagulation system. C4BP down-regulates complement activity in several ways: It binds to C4b thus inhibiting the formation of the classical pathway C3 convertase C4bC2a; it acts as a decay accelerating factor for existing convertases, probably by promoting dissociation of C2a; it is a cofactor in Factor I mediated C4b proteolysis.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CFHR dimers bind C3b, acting as competitive antagonists of Factor H (CFH) binding (de Jorge et al. 2013, Tortajada et al. 2013). CFHR1, CFHR2, and CFHR5 have a dimerization motif within their amino-terminal domains that enables formation of three homodimers (CFHR1:CFHR1, CFHR2:CFHR2, CFHR5:CFHR5) and three heterodimers (CFHR1:CFHR2, CFHR1:CFHR5, and CFHR2:CFHR5). Multiple binding interactions and avidity enable these dimers to out-compete CFH at physiologically relevant concentrations. CFHR2 homodimers bind C3b while allowing C3 convertase formation, but the CFHR2 bound convertases does not cleave C3 (Eberhardt et al. 2013). CFHR3 and CFHR4 do not contain the dimerization motif seen in CFHR1, 2 and 5 but compete with factor H for binding to C3b (Hellwage et al. 1999, Fritsche et al. 2010). CFHR4 exists predominantly as a dimer in plasma (Hellwage et al. 1999).As the main function of CFH is down-regulation of C3 activation through the alternative pathway amplification loop, CFHR dimers interfere with the C3b inhibitory actions of CFH, a process termed deregulation (de Jorge et al. 2013, Tortajada et al. 2013).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thioester bond hydrolysis causes conformational rearrangements that give C3(H2O) the ability to bind Factor B (Schreiber et al. 1978). The spontaneous hydrolysis rate of C3 under physiological conditions and temperature is about l% per hour, thus the C3b-like properties of C3(H2O) provide a continuous low level initiation of the alternative pathway of complement activation (Pangburn and Muller-Eberhard 1983).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carboxypeptidase N (CPN) is able to inactivate the complement anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a, and C5a (Bokisch and Müller-Eberhard 1970), 74-77 amino acid peptides that are released during complement activation. They mediate smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation, release of histamine from mast cells, and chemotaxis of selective bone marrow derived myeloid cells. C3a and C5a mediate their activities by binding the C3a receptor (C3AR1) and C5a receptor (C5AR1), respectively. CPN regulates these anaphylatoxins by removing their carboxy-terminal arginines, which reduces their biological activities 10-100-fold (Ember et al. 1998). Carboxypeptidase B2 (Plasma carboxypeptidase B, Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor, TAF1, CPB2) also can convert C3a and C5a to C3a-desArg and C5a-desArg (Campbell et al. 2002). C3a-desArg cannot bind C3AR1, and C5a-desArg has a 90% decrease in pro-inflammatory activity compared to C5a (Sayah et al. 2003).CPN is a tetramer comprised of two heterodimers each consisting of a CPN1 and CPN2 subunit (Levin et al. 1982, Keil et al. 2007). The catalytic CPN1 subunit ranges in size from 48 kDa to 55 kDa. This reflects processing by trypsin or plasmin, which can remove a C-terminal segment to produce the 48 kDa form, and cleave at Arg218-Arg219 to produce two peptide chains held together in an active conformation by non-covalent bonds (Levin et al. 1982, Quagraine et al. 2005). This step increases the catalytic activity of CPN towards chromogenic substrates.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C1 activation requires interaction with two separate Fc domains, so pentavalent IgM antibody is far more efficient at complement activation than IgG antibody (Muller-Eberhard and Kunkel 1961). Antibody binding results in a conformational change in the C1r component of the C1 complex and a proteolytic cleavage of C1r, activating it (Ziccardi and Cooper 1976). This reaction is irreversible under physiological conditions.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plasma protease C1 inhibitor (C1Inh, SERPING1) can bind the activated C1r and C1s proteases in the activated C1 complex, rendering them proteolytically inactive (Sim et al. 1979a) and leading to the disassembly of the C1 complex, releasing inactive C1r:C1Inh and C1s:C1Inh complexes (Arlaud et al. 1979, Sim et al. 1979b, Ziccardi and Cooper 1979). C1Inh also inhibits and controls certain non-antibody-induced as well as spontaneous C1 activation. Thus C1Inh plays an important role in regulating nonspecific complement activation (Ziccardi et al. 1983). C1Inh is also a major physiological inhibitor of kallikrein (Ratnoff et al. 1969), coagulation factors XIa and XIIa (Forbes et al. 1970), and the enzymatically active fragments derived from factor XIIa (factor XIIf) (Schreiber et al. 1973).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complement factor I (CFI) is a complex of one heavy and one light chain, both cleaved from the same precursor peptide. It inactivates complement subcomponents C3b, iC3b and C4b by proteolytic cleavage of the alpha chains of C4b and C3b in the presence of cofactors such as Factor H, C4b binding protein, Complement receptor 1 (CR1) or MCP (CD46).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metastable C3b can bind a wide variety of proteins and carbohydrates expressed on biological surfaces (Coico and Sunshine, 2009; Kimball 2010). This is an essentially random event (Dodds and Law, 1998); binding may be to host or microorganism. However, certain surface sugars have greater C3b binding rates, perhaps explaining variations in microorganism suceptibility (Pangburn, M. in The Complement System, Ed. Rother et al. 1998).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complement receptor CR2 (CD21) is predominantly expressed on the surface of B-cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). It binds the C3 fragments C3dg, C3d, and with lower affinity, inactive C3b (iC3b) on the antigen surface, where it forms the B cell co-receptor complex with CD19 and CD81 (Matsumoto et al. 1993). Co-ligation of receptors due to C3dg opsonisation lowers the threshold for B cell activation by 1000 to 10,000 times (Dempsey et al. 1996, Mongini et al. 1997); the C3d:CR2 complex induces an increase of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the presence of C3d-opsonized antigen on the B cell surface (Cherukuri et al. 2001). C3 is required for the induction and maintenance of B-cell lineage memory cells in germinal centers (GCs), where B cells encounter antigen-antibody-C3 fragment complexes on the surface of FDCs (Klaus and Humphrey 1986). C3d-opsonized antigen binds to CR2 on FDCs, which can present the antigen and induce effector and memory B cells (Fang et al. 1998).Complement fragments, iC3b and C3dg, are produced in vivo due to the actions of the complement serine protease, factor I. This enzyme cleaves C3b in the presence of cofactors (factor H, MCP/CD46, complement receptor 1/CR1/CD35) to generate iC3b. CR1 acts as a cofactor for further factor I-mediated cleavage to C3dg.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C3b:Bb is naturally labile with a half-life of ~90 s; association of the complex with properdin extends the half-life to ~30 min. (Medicus et al. 1976). Properdin is found in the blood as a mixture of multivalent oligomers: 30% dimers, 45% trimers, 10% tetramers, and 15% higher oligomers. Monomers associate with one another in a head-to-tail arrangement, producing closed circular structures (Smith et al. 1984; Alcorlo M et al. 2013). These features suggest that the properdin oligomer associated with a C3b:Bb complex on a surface such as a cell membrane can facilitate recruitment of additional C3b:Bb complexes to the site (Farries et al. 1988; Hourcade 2006).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MBL or ficolins binding to carbohydrates on the target surface results in conformational changes in the lectin:MASPs complex. It in turn promotes a cleavage of proenzyme form of MASP between the CCP2 and the serine protease domains, which results in the generation of the active form. The active form of MASP-2 is able to cleave C4 and C2 to generate the C3 convertase (Vorup-Jensen T et al. 2000; Chen CB and Wallis R 2004). The active form of MASP-1 was shown to facilitate the complement activation by either direct cleavage of complex-bound MASP-2 or cleavage of C2 bound to C4 (Matsushita M et al. 2000; Heja D et al. 2012).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the displacement of Bb from C3bBb, Factor I (CFI) cleaves Factor H-bound C3b producing iC3b, which remains bound to the membrane. The majority of the C3b alpha chain is retained as two fragments which are tethered to the beta chain by disulphide bonds. iC3b is proteolytically inactive and cannot contribute to the complement cascade process, though it still contributes to opsonization.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MBL polypeptide chain consists of a short N-terminal cysteine-rich region, a collagen-like region comprising 19 Gly-X-Y triplets, a 34-residue hydrophobic stretch, and a C-terminal C-type lectin domain. MBL monomers associate via their cysteine-rich and collagen-like regions to form homotrimers, and these in turn associate into oligomers. The predominant oligomers found in human serum contain three (MBL-I) or four (MBL-II) homotrimers (Fujita et al. 2004, Teillet et al. 2005). Extracellular MBL oligomers circulate as complexes with MASP1/2. In the presence of Ca2+, the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of MBL binds carbohydrates with 3- and 4- OH groups in the pyranose ring, such as mannose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Such motifs occur on the surfaces of viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The affinity of any one MBL binding site for a carbohydrate ligand is low, but interaction between multiple binding sites on an MBL oligomer and repetitive carbohydrate motifs on a target cell surface allow high-avidity binding. The specificity of the MBL binding site (it does not bind glucose or sialic acid) and the requirement for a repeated target motif may account for the failure of MBL to bind human glycoproteins under normal conditions (Petersen et al. 2001). This reaction in particular represents the interaction of MBL with bacterial mannose repeats.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The thioester linkage between cysteine residue 1010 and glutamine residue 1013 in the alpha chain of Complement factor 3 (C3) can spontaneously hydrolyze, yielding so-called C3(H2O) (Tack et al. 1980; Pangburn and Muller-Eberhard 1980; Pangburn et al. 1981). Thioester bond hydrolysis causes conformational rearrangements that give C3(H2O) the ability to bind Factor B. The spontaneous hydrolysis rate of C3 under physiological conditions and temperature is about l% per hour, thus the C3b-like properties of C3(H2O) provide a continuous low level initiation of the alternative pathway of complement activation (Pangburn and Muller-Eberhard 1983). If not bound by Factor B, C3(H2O) binds Factor H and is inactivated by Factor I</p>

Complement factor H-related protein 3 (FHR3) has also been reported to bind C3Bb leading to inhibition of C3Bb C3 convertase activity (Fritsche et al. 2010). CFH also acts as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C3b to iC3b.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C5AR2 (GPR77, C5L2) has been described as a receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptides anaphylatoxin C5a, C4a and C3a and even their des-arginated derivatives. Highest binding affinity was for C3a-desArg, also called Acylation Stimulating Protein (ASP), produced from C3a following arginine removal by carboxypeptidases. Binding of C3a and its derivatives has been disputed (Johswich et al. 2006) leading to suggestions that this receptor may be a C5a scavenger. It is weakly coupled to G(i)-mediated signaling pathways and believed to function primarily as a decoy receptor though it can interact with beta arrestin (Van Lith et al. 2009).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thrombin, coagulation factors XIa, Xa, IXa and plasmin (Amara et al. 2010) can cleave C3 and C5 to generate C3a and C5a. Neutrophil elastase (ELANE) can cleave C5 generating an active C5a-like fragment (Vogt 2000). Under normal conditions, thrombin cleavage of C5 may not be a physiologically significant reaction (Bagic et al. 2015) but the combined action of thrombin and convertases appears to enhance the efficiency of the lytic pathway (Krisinger et al. 2012). Clotting-induced production of thrombin leads to cleavage of C5 at the atypical site R947 in the CUB domain. C5a can be released from the atypical C5a fragment (termed C5aT) by conventional C5 convertases; the truncated C5b fragment, termed C5bT, can form a C5bT-9 membrane attack complex that has significantly increased lytic activity (Krisinger et al. 2012).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plasma protease C1 inhibitor (C1Inh, SERPING1) forms proteolytically inactive stoichiometric covalent complexes with the C1r and C1s proteases (Sim et al. 1979a). This effectively disassembles the C1 complex, releasing inactive C1r:C1Inh and C1s:C1Inh complexes (Arlaud et al. 1979, Sim et al. 1979b, Ziccardi and Cooper 1979). C1Inh also inhibits and controls certain non-antibody-induced as well as spontaneous C1 activation. Thus C1Inh plays an important role in regulating nonspecific complement activation (Ziccardi et al. 1983). C1Inh is also a major physiological inhibitor of kallikrein (Ratnoff et al. 1969), coagulation factors XIa and XIIa (Forbes et al. 1970), and the enzymatically active fragments derived from factor XIIa (factor XIIf) (Schreiber et al. 1973).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The membrane attack complex (MAC) is the cytolytic end product of the complement cascade, composed of one C5:C6:C7:C8 complex and 12 to 15 C9 molecules (Podack et al. 1982, Biesecker et al. 1993). 12 C9 molecules are represented in this reaction. C9 peptides polymerize to form a ring-shaped transmembrane channel, which causes osmotic lysis of the target cell (Kondos et al. 2010). While formation of a pore is typically associated with necrotic cell death, there is evidence of membrane permeabilization from MACs containing one C9 molecule per C5b–8 complex (Sims et al. 1983).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clusterin is a dimer of two fragments of the same translation product, which are disulfide bonded by five cysteines on each peptide (Tobe et al. 1991). It is able to modulate the terminal complement cascade in vitro and prevent cellular lysis by the membrane attack complex (MAC), C5b-9. Clusterin forms complexes with C5b:C6:C7, or C5b:C6:C7:C8 or C5b:C6:C7:C8:C9, as the proteins assemble into the amphiphilic MAC. Clusterin binding renders the complexes soluble and lytically inactive (Jenne and Tschopp 1989, Choi et al. 1989, Murphy et al. 1989, Tschopp et al. 1993).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recruitment of the C8 trimeric complex is mediated by the C8 beta chain (Monahan and Sodetz 1981). Binding enables C8 to undergo necessary conformational rearrangements that allow the C8 alpha chain to penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (Stecket et al. 1983, Weiland et al. 2014), firmly anchoring the C5b:C6:C7:C8 complex to the target cell membrane. A functional membrane pore can be formed by the C5b:C6:C7:C8 complex (Boyle et al. 1976, Tegla et al. 2011). These pores are small and unstable but can cause cell lysis if present in sufficient number (Martin et al. 1987). They also increase cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and thereby stimulate signalling pathways (Koski et al. 1983, Niculescu and Rus 2001).</p>

C4bC2a is also unstable, lasting at best a few minutes (Kerr et al. 1980). Decay is associated with the release of the Bb or C2a fragments respectively into the fluid phase. The liberated C3b/C4b is able to re-bind Bb/C2a if Factor B/C2 are present.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C5 convertases are serine proteases that cleave C5 with high efficiency; the C3 convertases can cleave C5 but have a poor affinity for C5, with a Km of 6-9 microM. The high affinity C5 convertases are generated when the low affinity C3/C5 convertases such as C4b:C2a deposit C3b by cleaving native C3. These C3b-containing C3/C5 convertases have Km values of 0.005 microM, well below the normal concentration of C5 in blood (0.37 microM). They have very low Vmax rates, just one C5 cleaved per 1–4 min per enzyme (Rawal and Pangburn 1998).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cleavage of C4 into C4a and C4b releases an acyl group from the intrachain thioester bond, allowing C4b to bond covalently to any adjacent biological substrates (Dodds and Law 1998). C4 is encoded at two loci, C4A and C4B. The C4b proteins derived from these genes are not identical and have different binding preferences (Law et al 1984, Sepp et al. 1993); C4A-derived C4b binds more efficiently than C4B-derived C4b to amino groups, while C4B-derived C4b is more effective than C4A in binding to hydroxyl groups. The site of C4b deposition is not clearly established (Møller-Kristensen et al. 2003) but generally accepted to be the activating cell membrane surface, though it may be the activating complex itself.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C4b and C2a bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4bC2a), C3b and the Bb fragment of Factor B form the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb). The C3(H2O):Bb C3 convertase is sometimes called the initiating convertase, and the C5 convertases also have C3 convertase activity (Rawal and Pangburn 2001).All three pathways merge at the proteolytic cleavage of component C3 by C3 convertases to form two fragments C3b and C3a. The cleavage of component C3 exposes a reactive thioester bond on C3b, leading to the covalent attachment of C3b to glycoproteins on the target cell surface (Law SK et al. 1979; Tack BF et al. 1980). The opsonization with C3b enables the recruitment of phagocytes (Newman SL et al. 1985; Gadjeva M et al. 1998). In addition, C3b anchors the assembly of C3/C5 convertases leading to an amplification of C3 cleavage and effecting C5 activation (Fearon DT 1979; Takata Y et al 1987; Kinoshita T et al. 1988). Moreover, the activation of C3b exposes binding sites for factors B, H and I, properdin, decay accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), complement receptor 1 (CR1) and microbial molecules such as vaccinia virus complement-control protein and staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) from Staphylococcus aureus (Forneris F et al. 2010; Morgan HP et al. 2011; Nilsson SC et al. 2010; Lambris JD et al. 1984; Medof ME et al.1984; Barilla-LaBarca ML et al. 2002; Smith BO et al. 2002; Bernet J et al. 2004; Garcia Bl et al. 2010) . C3b associates with these molecules to mediate the activation, amplification and regulation of the complement response.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ficolin-3 (H-ficolin, FCN3, Hakata antigen) consists of a collagen-like strand and three C-terminal recognition domains, which bind to carbohydrates on the target surface. Circulating FCN3 is associated with mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASP). Upon ligand binding the FCN3:MASP complex triggers activation of the lectin pathway (Matsushita et al. 2002, Teillet et al. 2008, Zacho et al. 2012). FCN3 can specifically recognize Aerococcus viridans (Tsujimura et al. 2002, Zacho et al. 2012) and binds patterns of bacterial polysaccharides such as d-fucose and galactose (Garlatti et al. 2007). In adition to pathogenic ligands, FCN3 was reported to bind apoptotic Jurkat cells (Kuraya et al. 2005).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The alpha chain of C4 is cleaved, releasing an N-terminal portion of this chain as C4a. The beta and gamma chains are not cleaved and remain linked to the alpha chain by disulfide bonds (Nagasawa et al. 1976, 1980). The resulting C4b heterotrimer undergoes a gross conformational change; the internal thioester in C4b becomes exposed and able to form covalent bonds with surrounding molecules (Law and Dodds 1997). A large proportion of the bonds formed are with water, but some will attach C4b to biological surfaces (Rother et al. 1998). This irreversible reaction can be catalyzed by activated MBL, generated through the lectin pathway of complement activation (Fujita et al. 2004; Hajela et al. 2002), and by activated C1, generated through the classical pathway (Muller-Eberhard and Lepow 1965).N.B. Humans have two highly polymorphic loci for Complement factor 4, C4A and C4B. C4A alleles carry the Rodgers (Rg) blood group antigens while the C4B alleles carry the Chido (Ch) blood group antigens. The two loci encode non identical C4 peptides; C4 derived from C4A reacts more rapidly with the amino groups of peptide antigens while C4B allotypes react more rapidly with the hydroxyl group of carbohydrate antigens. The names of the two loci are always represented in uppercase. C4a and C4b refer to the peptide products of Complement Factor 4 cleavage.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cleavage of C5 by C5 convertases is the last enzymatic step in the complement activation. C5 convertases are formed when C3b molecule is covalently deposited in the immediate vicinity of pre-assembled C3 convertases switching them to C5 convertases C4bC2aC3b and C3bBbC3b (Takata Y et al 1987; Kinoshita T et al. 1988; Rawal N and Pangburn MK 2001, 2003). The additional C3b acts like an anvil for C5; it interacts with C5 and presents C5 in the correct conformation for cleavage by the C2a or Bb enzyme. The proteolytic cleavage of C5 generates the small fragment C5a and the large fragment C5b.C5b initiates an assembly of terminal complement components (C6-C9) leading to the formation of membrane attack complex (MAC) on the target surface (Aleshin AE et al. 2012; Hadders MA et al. 2012). MAC disrupts the cell membrane causing a subsequent cell death through osmotic lysis. Anaphylatoxin C5a mediates pro-inflammatory and immunemodulatory signals via its receptors C5aR and C5L2. The anaphylatoxin receptors are found on surfaces of phagocytes as well as other cell types. In inflammation, they induce cytokine production, degranulation and chemotaxis of leukocytes (Monk PN et al. 2007).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Binding of the plasma protease C1 inhibitor (C1Inh, SERPING1) to the C1s and C1r subunits of the C1 complex leads to C1 disassembly, releasing inactive C1r:C1Inh and C1s:C1Inh complexes (Arlaud et al. 1979, Sim et al. 1979, Ziccardi and Cooper 1979). Thus C1Inh plays an important role in regulating nonspecific complement activation (Ziccardi et al. 1983).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) is a widely distributed membrane protein. It accelerates the dissociation of C3bBb and C4C2a, thereby inhibiting the amplification of complement. DAF can bind C3b and Bb but must bind both for efficient decay acceleration. The regulatory function of DAF is believed to be inhibition of activated C3 convertase enzymes rather than binding of inactive proenzymes (Harris et al. 2007).</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C7 recruitment of C7 results in a weak association of C5b:C6:C7 with the target cell membrane, through a poorly characterized molecular mechanism (Muller -Eberhard et al. 1986). C5b and C6 remains loosely bound to C3b until C5b binds to C7 and induces it to undergo a hydrophilic-amphiphilic transition. Hydrophobic binding regions for phospholipid are thereby exposed, and the trimolecular complex is endowed with a metastable membrane binding site. Membranebound C5b-7 inflicts no harm on a cell but marks it for further assault.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1, CL-11, COLEC11) (Keshi et al. 2006) forms disulfide-bridged stable heteromers with collectin liver 1 (CL-L1, COLEC10) (Otahani et al. 1999), with a ratio of one COLEC10 to two COLEC11 polypeptide chains. The majority of plasma COLEC11 was found in complex with COLEC10 (Henriksen et al. 2013). The resulting COLEC10:2xCOLEC11 heterocomplex, termred CL-LK, contains multiple Ca2+ -dependent carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) and collagen-like regions, which allow high-avidity binding (KD ~10-9 M) to target cell surface carbohydrate patterns (Bajic et al. 2015); COLEC11 recognizes L-fucose and D-mannose and the disaccharide D-mannose(alpha1-2)-D-mannose (Keshi et al. 2006, Hansen et al. 2010, Selman and Hansen 2012, ). CL-LK can bind mannose-rich patterns on M. tuberculosis (Troegeler et al. 2015). The CL-LK complex was able to bind mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs) in vitro with affinities in the nM range, and was associated with MASP1/3 and MASP2 in plasma. Upon binding to mannan or DNA in the presence of MASP2, the COLEC10:COLEC11 complex mediated deposition of C4b (Henriksen et al. 2013). Polymorphisms in the COLEC11 gene cause 3MC syndrome (Rooryck et al. 2011).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">C5a (Fernandez HN and Hugli TE, 1978) is a protein fragment released from complement component C5. C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin, causing the release of histamine from mast cells and also being an effective leukocyte attractant. The C5a receptor (complement component 5a receptor 1, C5AR1; Cluster of Differentiation 88, CD88) (Gerard NP and Gerard C, 1991) mediates the pro-inflammatory and chemotactic actions of C5a.</p>

        <notes>
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ficolin-1 (M-ficolin or FCN1) was shown to localize at the cell surface of circulating monocytes and granulocytes, despite lacking an obvious transmembrane domain, (Teh C et al. 2000; Honore C et al. 2010). Ficolin-1 has also been found in human plasma (Honore C et al. 2008; Wittenborn T et al. 2010; Kjaer TR et al. 2011). Monocytes and macrophages, but not immature dendritic cells were reported to secrete Ficolin-1 into the serum (Honore C et al. 2010). Moreover, early studies revealed its presence in secretory granules of peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes (Liu Y et al. 2005). Soluble Ficolin-1 was found to form a complex with MASP2, while cell surface-bound Ficolin-1 did not associate with MASP (Honore C et al. 2010; Kjaer TR et al. 2011).Ficolin-1 specifically recognizes sialic acid and can bind to acetylated compounds such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) (Garlatti V et al. 2007; Gout E et al. 2010; Kjaer TR et al. 2011).</p>
